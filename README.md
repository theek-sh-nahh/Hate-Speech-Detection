In the vast expanse of the digital universe, toxic comments are akin to black holes, absorbing 
positivity and emitting negativity. They lurk in the shadows of online platforms, casting a pall 
of hostility and discord. As custodians of these digital ecosystems, our mission is to illuminate 
these shadows, to identify and neutralize these sources of toxicity. This is not merely a task, it 
is a crusade for digital harmony.

Sentiment analysis is a pivotal aspect of natural language processing (NLP) that aids businesses in 
understanding customer emotions and sentiments expressed in textual data. In this project, we 
focus on the classification of toxic comments, a critical task for online platforms aiming to 
maintain a positive and inclusive environment. Leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to 
develop a robust classifier capable of identifying toxic comments accurately. The project employs 
the Toxic Comment Classification Challenge dataset, offering a rich collection of labeled 
comments for training and evaluation. This project employs the Toxic Comment Classification
